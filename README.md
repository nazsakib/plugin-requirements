# Plugin Requirements

Ensure your WordPress plugin complies with these essential guidelines:

1. **Plugin Name:** Clearly define your plugin's identity.
2. **Description:** Provide a concise overview of your plugin's functionality.
3. **Version:** Specify the current version of your plugin.
4. **Author:** Credit yourself or your team.
5. **License:** Clearly state the licensing terms.
